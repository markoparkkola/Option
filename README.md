# Option
Option support for C#

Because nulls are evil. Nulls lead to null references. Null references lead to Dark Side.

Microsoft thought about demolishing nulls from C# but because they didn't, here's an option for you! (pun intended)

Use as you may. If you want me to write something else, send me message somehow, don't know how.

Btw. I believe if one would want to do this 100% right, one would have to write a facade to huge amount of .NET library classes. Take for instance FirstOrOption extension method I wrote (there's actually two of them, the other takes predicate). That was easy and fast to do but now I have this nagging feeling I should write SingleOrOption method also.
